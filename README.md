## Authentication-A website named "Corporategirl" where you can read secrets about companies - inspired by gossipgirl, fishbowl and glassdoor. A user can create an account or sign-in to post and delete a secret they know about the company.

## Serverside app-A place to post about your favourite films :)
Our app allows the user to create an account and log-in subsequently. The app's purpose is to allow the user to upload stills from their favourite movie.
